# MarkdownIndexer
A simple CLI-Tool to create table of contents and filestructures
in markdown documents

## How to use
Run the binary for help. This tool will recursively search for .md files  
in its subdirectorys and optionally apply its features to them (if they contain a special key (described in help))

## Install
Build it by cloning the repo and running `cargo build --release`  
or by downloading an already [compiled version](./target/release/MarkdownIndexer.exe) for `x86_64 Windows`
